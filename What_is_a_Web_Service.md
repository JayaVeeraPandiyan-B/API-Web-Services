Rendu vishyathuku nadula communication tool ah irukurathu tha API

Web Service:

        * Web applications ku Web Service API use aaguthu
        * Web applications ku nadula communication tool ah irukku
        * Communication ku standard protocol/format irukku

Why we use it:

        * ithu platform independent
        * Example: oru application C# and windows 10 la irukku and innoru application Java and Linux la irukku naalum ithu communicate panikum 

Question	Answer:

What’s the main difference?	- Web services use HTTP/HTTPS; APIs can use any protocol.

Are all web services APIs? - Yes, web services are a subset of APIs.

Are all APIs web services? - No, many APIs don’t use web protocols.

When to use SOAP? - Enterprise systems, financial transactions, high security.

When to use REST? - Modern web apps, public APIs, microservices.

Can APIs be local? - Yes, APIs can work without a network.

Must web services use HTTP? - Yes. By definition, web services use HTTP/HTTPS.

Which is more flexible? - APIs. Web services have specific constraints.

*************************************

APIs and web services represent different approaches to software communication:

  * Use APIs when you need flexible communication across various protocols and formats.

  * Use web services when you need a consistent, standardized way to communicate over HTTP/HTTPS.

What is an API?

An application programming interface (API) defines how different software components interact. APIs can use various protocols, data formats, and architectures.

They can connect:

  * Locally (same machine)

  * Across networks

  * In cloud environments

APIs can be built on REST, GraphQL, gRPC, WebSockets, or even custom RPC systems.

*************************************

What is a web service?

A web service is an API designed to communicate over the web using HTTP or HTTPS. It adheres to established standards for interoperability(Connecting) across systems and platforms.

A web service API:

 * Always uses HTTP/HTTPS

 * Typically exchanges XML (SOAP) or JSON (REST)

 * Requires network communication

 * Provides machine-readable service descriptions (WSDL, OpenAPI)

 * Enables platform-independent interoperability(Connecting)
